A/B testing
The impact of a discount message on the decision to purchase a product
Research context
Hypothesis 0: the discount message doesn't have any influence on the decision to purchase a product (the conversion from registration to subscription almost does not change)
Hypothesis 1: if users are informed about the availability of a discount, the conversion to purchase will increase, even if in fact the price remains the same
Group A: we offer users to purchase a subscription for USD4.99
Group B: we offer users to purchase a subscription for USD4.99, but we say that this is a 50% discount price

Conclusions of the A/B test:
General data:
The total duration of the test was 22 days
10,013 respondents participated in group A, and 9,985 in group B
Respondents in group A were offered to buy a subscription at the regular price of USD4.99, respondents in group B were also offered to buy a subscription for USD4.99, but it was noted that this was a 50% discount price
At the same time, the number of conversions in group B turned out to be higher and amounted to 889 versus 611 in group A
The conversion rate in group B is 8.9%, in group A â€“ 6.1%
1. As a result of conducting an independent A/B test, we obtained a p-value level that is outside the statistically significant range, which allowed us to reject the null hypothesis that the discount message does not affect the decision to purchase a subscription
2. The alternative hypothesis that that a discount message increases conversion to purchase is true. We accept the alternative hypothesis
